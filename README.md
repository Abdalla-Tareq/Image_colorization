# 🎨 Colorization of Images & Videos using Deep Learning
## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on colorizing black-and-white images and videos using deep learning. The model utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict realistic colors for grayscale images. The implementation is based on PyTorch and trained on a dataset of colored images to learn meaningful mappings from grayscale to RGB.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Image Colorization – Convert black-and-white images to color.
- ✅ Video Colorization – Frame-by-frame processing for grayscale videos.
- ✅ Deep Learning Model – Uses CNN-based architecture for learning color representations.
- ✅ GPU Acceleration – Utilizes CUDA for faster processing (if available).
- ✅ Dataset Handling – Supports loading and preprocessing large datasets.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
**Python 3.12**
**PyTorch – Deep learning framework**
**Torchvision – Dataset and transformation utilities**
**OpenCV – Video frame processing**
**NumPy & PIL – Image manipulation**

## 📊 Model Training & Evaluation
**Dataset: Trained on a large dataset of colored images.**
**Loss Function: Measures the difference between predicted and actual colors.**
**Evaluation Metrics: Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), PSNR, and Mean Squared Error (MSE).**

## 🔧 How to Use?
**1️⃣ Run the training script to train the model.**
**2️⃣ Use the trained model to colorize images or videos.**
